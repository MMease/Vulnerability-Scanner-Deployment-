<h1> Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Deployment </h1>
In this comprehensive tutorial, I will walk you through the process of setting up a virtual machine on VMware Workstation and deploying the powerful Nessus vulnerability scanner. By following these steps, you will be able to identify potential dangers on your system and fortify your network against security threats effectively..<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware
- Nessus 
- Remote Desktop (RDP)

<h2> Installation Steps </h2>

Step 1: Install VMware Workstation
- Download and install VMware Workstation on your host machine (https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).
  
![VMware start](https://github.com/MMease/Vulnerability-Scanner-Deployment-/assets/42321472/68c84a0d-dfb2-4499-b4d0-a169a2b3d497)

Step 2: Obtain the Operating System ISO
- Download the ISO image of the windows OS (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

Step 3: Create a New Virtual Machine
- Launch VMware Workstation and click on "Create a New Virtual Machine."

Step 4: Select the ISO Image
- Browse and select the downloaded ISO image of the operating system.

Step 5: Configure Virtual Machine
- Provide a name for your virtual machine and choose a location to save it on your host machine.
- Specify the disk size for the virtual machine. You can choose to split the virtual disk into multiple files or use a single file for the disk.

Step 6: Customize Hardware Settings
-  Change memory to 4 GB (recommended so VM doesn't move slow). Also set Network Adaptor to "Bridged". After this step is finished, complete the setup wizard.

Step 8: Install the Operating System
- Power on the virtual machine, and it will boot from the ISO image you provided.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system on the virtual machine.

Step 9: Making Machine Vulnerable 
- Go to setting and Turn off updates. This will stop the image from updating during the demo.
- Next click <b>"View update history"</b> >> <b>"Uninstall updates"</b> and uninstall any previous updates.

- Turn VMs firewall off. Go to <b>"Windows Defender Firewall"</b> >> <b>"Advanced settings"</b> >> "Windows Defender Firewall Properties". A screen will pop out with three different profiles. Turn all of them off.  (If on Nessus can't connect)

![No firewall](https://github.com/MMease/Vulnerability-Scanner-Deployment-/assets/42321472/8b90eb27-b55e-4767-b3c0-75d96eb6f0a4)

Step 10: Ensure VM and Nessus share Networks
- In the VM click on <b>"Devices"</b> on the home screen then <b>"Network"</b> >> <b>"Network Settings"</b> >> and change network to <b>"Host-only Adapter"</b>

Step 11: Download and Install Nessus 
- Visit the Tenable website (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) and download the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner for Linux.
- Follow the process and enter activation code.

Step 12: Configure Nessus and start using scan
- Click <b>"New Scan"</b> >> <b>"Basic Network Scan"</b> and enter a name for your scan. In the 'targets' section enter the VMs IP address.
