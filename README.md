<h1> Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Deployment </h1>
In this comprehensive tutorial, I will walk you through the process of setting up a virtual machine on VMware Workstation and deploying the powerful Nessus vulnerability scanner. By following these steps, you will be able to identify potential dangers on your system and fortify your network against security threats effectively..<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware
- Nessus 
- Remote Desktop (RDP)

<h2> Installation Steps </h2>

Step 1: Install VMware Workstation
- Download and install VMware Workstation on your host machine (https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).

Step 5: Configure Virtual Machine
- Provide a name for your virtual machine and choose a location to save it on your host machine.
- Specify the disk size for the virtual machine. You can choose to split the virtual disk into multiple files or use a single file for the disk.

Step 6: Customize Hardware Settings
-  Change memory to 4 GB (recommended so VM doesn't move slow). Also set Network Adaptor to "Bridged". After this step is finished, complete the setup wizard.

Step 8: Install the Operating System
- Power on the virtual machine, and it will boot from the ISO image you provided.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system on the virtual machine.

Step 9: Download Nessus Vulnerability Scanner
- Visit the Tenable website (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) and download the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner for Linux.

Step 10: Transfer Nessus Installer to the Virtual Machine
- Upload the downloaded Nessus installer to the virtual machine. You can use tools like SCP or shared folders in VMware to do this.

Step 11: Install Nessus on the Virtual Machine
- Open a terminal on the virtual machine and navigate to the directory containing the Nessus installer.
- Follow the installation instructions provided by Nessus to install the vulnerability scanner.

Step 12: Activate Nessus
- Once Nessus is installed, activate it using the provided activation code during the setup process.

Step 13: Access Nessus Web Interface
- After activation, Nessus will be accessible through a web interface. Open a web browser on the virtual machine and navigate to the Nessus URL, typically: https://localhost:8834/

Step 14: Configure Nessus
- Follow the on-screen instructions to configure Nessus, create a user account, and set up scan policies.

Step 15: Perform a Vulnerability Scan
- Utilize Nessus to perform vulnerability scans on the virtual machine and other systems within your network.
